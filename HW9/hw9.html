<h1>Homework 9: Choropleth & Proportional Symbol </h1>
<h2>Katarina Holecek</h2>
<h3>The map shown below is a mix of a choropleth and proportional symbol map. It can be used to discern what percentage of a county's population is in poverty. I wanted to add the pie chart to the map to show how race and ethnicity tie into this. In most cases, minorities are usually in the places of lower income and/or higher poverty due to institutionalized and systemic racism. To my surprise, it does not seem like this trend holds true for most counties in Washington.</h3>
