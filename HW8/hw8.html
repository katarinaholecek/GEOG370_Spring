<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratio & Categories </h1>
<h2>Katarina Holecek</h2>
<h3>This first map shows the ratio in an equal interval. Though this would be super helpful for a large amount of data that does not have a ton of outliers, it oversimplifies the data and is not able to fully illustrate the ratio of people in poverty to the total population per county.</h3>

<h3>This map shows the ratio of people in poverty to total people in pretty breaks. Like the last map, it does not illustrate the data as well as it could, because the breaks in percentages are too wide and do not show a lot of deviation.</h3>

<h3>This last map shows the ratio using natural breaks. If you want to see the most information possible, I would suggest this mode because it will represent ALL of the data even in cases of extremes.</h3>
