<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Katarina Holecek</h2>
<h3>Are Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) Disproportionately Placed in Lower Income Zipcodes of Duplin County, NC?</h3>
<h4>In this map I used the Buffer and Intersection Geoprocessing tools. I first intersected the shapefile of counties to just show Duplin County. I intersected zipcodes within Duplin County and AFOs within Duplin County as well. I used the buffer to show a 1 mile radius from each AFO. Though there is no defined buffer for human proximity to AFOs there has been speculation that living within 1-3 miles of an AFO increases risk of respiratory illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis. As you can see in the map below, almost ALL of Duplin County is covered by this buffer. If you take a closer look, the places without coverage are in zipcodes with lower poverty levels. On a larger scale, this amount of coverage is dangerously high compared to other counties in NC. After doing some research I found out that Duplin county is in the bottom 5% of all counties for income.   </h4>
